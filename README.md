# Music Database

#### Project Description:
Java GUI that retrieves information from a database. This was a group project for my Database Management class. Our idea was to make a database that held information about music artists (such as their name, label, songs, albums), and this database would be accessible via a user interface. In this interface, users would be able to select which category of information they wanted (such as if they wanted every song by a certain artist).    

From this idea, we first had to come up with the schema for our database. As a group we came up with the basic outline and primary keys needed. A member of the group then worked to write the schema (procedures, triggers, etc). I was tasked with creating the GUI. The interface was created with Java Swing, and had a JDBC connection to the database, which is how it retrieved the data.
